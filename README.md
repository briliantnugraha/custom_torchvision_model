# custom_torchvision_model
 Custom Intermediate Layer from Tochvision Model

Intended users:
FPN with C3, C4, and C5

Due to lack of resources, I do some research on how to:
- Decompose the provided models from torchvision
- Reconstruct it again with customized output
- Retrieve the desired output
- It could be used for:
     * Semantic Segmentation (with FPN or combination of output)
     * Object Detection/ Instance Segmentation (with FPN or combination of output)
     * CNN basic (with FPN or combination of output)
     * ETC
